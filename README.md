calculator for simple functionality 

## User Stories

### 1. Basic Calculations:
As a user, I want to be able to enter numbers to perform simple calculations.
As a user, I want to use basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to carry out mathematical operations.
As a user, I want to see the result of a calculation by pressing the "=" button to get the final value.

### 2. Advanced Mathematical Functions:
As a user, I want to use parentheses ( ) to perform complex calculations with proper order of operations.
As a user, I want to enter decimal numbers to perform precise calculations with floating-point values.
As a user, I want an "AC" (All Clear) button to quickly clear all inputs.

### 3. Usability:
As a user, I want the calculator to display error messages (e.g., "ERROR") when I perform invalid calculations.
As a user, I want to correct my input by deleting a single character (backspace function).
As a user, I want the calculator to be responsive so that it works well on both mobile devices and computers.
As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts to type faster.

### 4. Design and Display:
As a user, I want the result to be bold and easy to read so that I can clearly see it.
As a user, I want the calculator to have an intuitive layout so that I can use it without instructions.

### 5. Security and Stability:
As a user, I want the calculator to avoid security risks so that no unexpected actions are triggered (e.g., through insecure code like eval).
As a user, I want the calculator to be stable even when I perform many complex calculations in a row.
