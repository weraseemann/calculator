# Pet-PROJECT: Calculator
Calculator for simple functionality 

## User Stories

### 1. Basic Calculations:
- As a user, I want to be able to enter numbers to perform simple calculations.
- As a user, I want to use basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to carry out mathematical operations.
- As a user, I want to see the result of a calculation by pressing the "=" button to get the final value.
- As a user, I want to be able to use the % button in calculations, so that I can easily calculate percentages, like discounts or proportions.

### 2. Advanced Mathematical Functions:
- As a user, I want to use parentheses ( ) to perform complex calculations with proper order of operations.
- As a user, I want to enter decimal numbers to perform precise calculations with floating-point values.
- As a user, I want an "AC" (All Clear) button to quickly clear all inputs.

### 3. Usability:
- As a user, I want the calculator to display error messages (e.g., "ERROR") when I perform invalid calculations.
- As a user, I want to correct my input by deleting a single character (backspace function).
- As a user, I want the calculator to be responsive so that it works well on both mobile devices and computers.
- As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts to type faster.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the entire mathematical expression, including the beginning of long numbers, so that I can easily review and verify my input without losing any part of it.
- As a user,
I want to use a single button to insert both opening and closing brackets,
so that I can add parentheses more easily without using two separate buttons.

### 4. Design and Display:
- As a user, I want the result to be bold and easy to read so that I can clearly see it.
- As a user, I want the calculator to have an intuitive layout so that I can use it without instructions.

### 5. Security and Stability:
- As a user, I want the calculator to avoid security risks so that no unexpected actions are triggered (e.g., through insecure code like eval).
- As a user, I want the calculator to be stable even when I perform many complex calculations in a row.

## Style: Desperate Housewives
The Desperate Housewives aesthetic is a mix of classy, vintage, and luxurious suburban housewife vibesâ€”think elegant, feminine, pastel colors, floral patterns, and a hint of 1950s glamour.

Key Design Features for the CSS:
- Soft pastel tones (blush pink, cream, mint, champagne gold).
- Elegant typography (cursive, serif font combos).
- Vintage-inspired buttons with soft shadows & rounded corners.
- Subtle floral & lace-like patterns for a chic look.
- Glossy finishes and gradient backgrounds for a high-end feel.

Why This Screams Desperate Housewives:
- Chic pastel color palette: Inspired by vintage fashion, floral wallpapers, and high-end suburban homes.
- Gold & champagne accents: Give it that luxurious, glamorous touch.
- Soft, feminine aesthetics: Rounded buttons, subtle shadows, and cursive fonts feel classy & polished.
- Glossy hover effects: Buttons shimmer when hovered, adding an elegant transition.
