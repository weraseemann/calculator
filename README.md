- As a user, I want to see the result of a calculation by pressing the "=" button to get the final value.
- As a user, I want to be able to use the % button in calculations, so that I can easily calculate percentages, like discounts or proportions.

### 2. Advanced Mathematical Functions:
- As a user, I want to use parentheses ( ) to perform complex calculations with proper order of operations.
- As a user, I want to enter decimal numbers to perform precise calculations with floating-point values.

- As a user, I want the calculator to be responsive so that it works well on both mobile devices and computers.
- As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts to type faster.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the entire mathematical expression, including the beginning of long numbers, so that I can easily review and verify my input without losing any part of it.
- As a user,
I want to use a single button to insert both opening and closing brackets,
so that I can add parentheses more easily without using two separate buttons.

### 4. Design and Display:
- As a user, I want the result to be bold and easy to read so that I can clearly see it.
- As a user, I want the calculator to have an intuitive layout so that I can use it without instructions.

### 5. Security and Stability:
- As a user, I want the calculator to avoid security risks so that no unexpected actions are triggered (e.g., through insecure code like eval).
- As a user, I want the calculator to be stable even when I perform many complex calculations in a row.
