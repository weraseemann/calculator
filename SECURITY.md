# 🔒 Security Policy
✅ Supported Versions
This project operates as a Progressive Web App (PWA). All updates made by the developer are applied instantly and automatically — there are no separate version downloads or manual updates required.

As a PWA, the app always delivers the most up-to-date version when accessed. Users benefit from automatic updates without needing to install new versions manually, as is often necessary with native apps.
